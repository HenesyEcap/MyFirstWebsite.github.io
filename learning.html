 <h1 style="font-size:20pt;">The C++ </h1>
 
    <p> general-purpose object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Labs in 1979. C++ was originally called 'C with classes,' and was built as an extension of the C language. Its name reflects its origins; C++ literally means 'increment C by 1

  <p>  What is the basic structure of a C++ program? <br>

Structure of a C++ program
A C++ program is structured in a specific and particular manner. In C++, a program is divided into the following three sections:

Standard Libraries Section
Main Function Section
Function Body Section </p>
<p>
For example, lets look at the implementation of the Hello World program:

    <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W2XBNFmzadg/Wf5qcgD7d0I/AAAAAAAADpg/Y_piEQbpUcQ0KoeNYEOzJcALVQK6x3RVwCLcBGAs/s1600/helloworld1.jpg" alt="hello world" width="500" height="150">

    
    </p>
    
    <p>  namespace std;
#include is a specific preprocessor command that effectively copies and pastes the entire text of the file, specified between the angle brackets, into the source code. 


The file <iostream>, which is a standard file that should come with the C++ compiler, is short for input-output streams. This command contains code for displaying and getting an input from the user.

namespace is a prefix that is applied to all the names in a certain set. iostream file defines two names used in this program - cout and endl.

This code is saying: Use the cout and endl tools from the std toolbox.

Main function section 
1
int main() {}
The starting point of all C++ programs is the main function.

This function is called by the operating system when your program is executed by the computer.

{ signifies the start of a block of code, ​and } signifies the end.

Function body section
1 
  cout << "Hello World" << endl;
2 
  return 0;
The name cout is short for character output and displays whatever is between the << brackets.

Symbols such as << can also behave like functions and are used with the keyword cout.

The return keyword tells the program to return a value to the function int main

After the return statement, execution control returns to the operating system component that launched this program.

  <p style="font-size:15px">C++ is also used in writing database management software. The two most popular databases MySQL and Postgres are written in C++.<b>

MYSQL Serve
MySQL, one of the most popular database software that is used widely in many real-world applications is written in C++.

<p style= "font-size: 15px">1. 
The int keyword is used to indicate integers.
Its size is usually 4 bytes. Meaning, it can store values from -2147483648 to 2147483647<br> 
For example : 
 <br> 
   <code style = "font-size:13px" > int salary =1000;</code>
   
   </p> 
   
     <p style= "font-size: 15px">2. Keyword char is used for characters.
Its size is 1 byte.
Characters in C++ are enclosed inside single quotes ' '.
<br> 
For example : 
 <br> 
   <code style = "font-size:13px" >char test = 'h' ;</code>
   
   </p> 
   
<p style= "font-size: 15px">3. The bool data type has one of two possible values: true or false.
Booleans are used in conditional statements and loops
<br> 
For example : 
 <br> 
   <code style = "font-size:13px" >bool cond = false;</code>
   
   </p> 
   
   
    <p style= "font-size: 15px">4.5 float and double are used to store floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials).
The size of float is 4 bytes and the size of double is 8 bytes. Hence, double has two times the precision of float. To learn more, visit C++ float and double. 
<br> 
For example : 
 <br> 
   <code style = "font-size:13px" >float area = 80.74;
double volume = 100.687874;</code>
   
   </p> 
   
 <p style= "font-size: 15px">6. Strings are used for storing text. A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes
<br> 
For example : 
 <br> 
   <code style = "font-size:13px" >string saysomething = "Hello";</code>
   
   </p> 
   
    <p style= "font-size: 15px">7. Wide character wchar_t is similar to the char data type, except its size is 2 bytes instead of 1.
It is used to represent characters that require more memory to represent them than a single char.
<br> 
For example : 
 <br> 
   <code style = "font-size:13px" >wchar_t test = L'ם' </code>
   
   </p> 
   
       <p style= "font-size: 15px">8.The void keyword indicates an absence of data. It means "nothing" or "no value". 
   </p> 
   
   
    <h3> C++ Type Modifiers </h3>
    
        
    <p style= "font-size: 15px"> We can further modify some of the fundamental data types by using type modifiers.</p>
